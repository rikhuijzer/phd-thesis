  *Predicting dropout in special forces selection* \
  by Rik Huijzer.

+ Psychology's near-total focus on explaining the causes of behavior has led to theories with little (or unknown) ability to accurately predict future behaviors (this thesis).
+ Machine learning's near-total focus on predictive performance has led to accurate models with possibly unsafe, unfair, or unreliable predictions (this thesis).
+ A solution is to combine prediction and explanation (this thesis).
+ We can predict dropout in special forces selection reasonably well, but confirmation in practice is necessary (this thesis).
+ Physical measures better predict dropout in special forces selection than psychological measures (this thesis).
+ It is easier to predict dropout than to predict graduation (this thesis).
+ Recognize reality even when you don't like it. Especially when you don't like it (Charlie Munger).
+ In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is.
