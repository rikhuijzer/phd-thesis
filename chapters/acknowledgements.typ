This thesis is based on the ideas from friends, family, mentors, and teachers in major ways.
I would like to thank the following people by listing some ideas that they contributed.
When there are quotation marks, the text is a literal quote.
Otherwise, the text is my best effort to summarize an idea that people told me or taught me through their actions.

\
*Age de Wit*: Hmm yes that sounds nice in theory, but in practice it won't work because ... \
*Frank Blaauw*: Don't focus too much on reasons why the approach might not work, but instead have some optimism and focus on why the approach might work. \
*Hanna Tobaben*: Not everything is binary. \
*John Boyd*, *Elon Musk*, and *Steve Jobs*: Challenge all assumptions. \
*John Von Neumann* and *Hylke Donkers*: With enough free parameters, you can fit an elephant. \
*Maurits Baatenburg de Jong*: Be humble. \
*Nely Schutte*, *Ben Graham*, and *Warren Buffett*: "You're not right or wrong because a thousand people agree with you and you're not right or wrong because a thousand people disagree with you. You are right when your facts and reasoning are right." \
*Peter de Jonge*: Don't forget to give sincere compliments from time to time. \
*Ruud den Hartigh*: Don't postpone things that you can do today. \
*Wout Huijzer*: "Gewoon rustig doorgaan." (Just calmly continue.) \
*Yannick Hill* and *Jose Storopoli*: It's okay to sometimes complain about things, but at some point you just have to get the work done. \
\
To these people and the many other people who's ideas ended up in this thesis, thank you.
