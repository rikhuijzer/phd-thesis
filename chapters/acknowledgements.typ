If it turns out I have seen more, it is because I stood on the shoulders of giants.
I would like to thank everybody who supported me in the past years to make this dissertation possible.

I would like to thank my supervisors Ruud, Frank and Peter for their continuous support and guidance.
"Challenge all assumptions" is an idea that I think is very important, but at the same time I am aware that this made me a difficult student.
There have been many assumptions that I have challenged, where it turned out I was wrong.
This must have been very frustrating since the supervisers had to spend time to explain why the these obvious assumptions were correct.
To make things worse, I often did not listen to the counterarguments.
This has lead to some explosive meetings where the supervisors luckily kept their cool and have been very capable in calming me down and finding a common ground.
From time to time, I have taken their advice to heart and I am grateful for their guidance.

From Peter I have learned that it not such a bad idea to give sincere compliments from time to time.
I always thought "why give a compliment, they already know they are doing a good job", but Peter made me change my mind and I am very grateful for that.
Peter has suggested many of the statistical methods that were used in this thesis.
Also, Peter has found clever ways in which to address some difficult reviewer comments.
I'm still most impressed by Peter's ability to take a complex situation and express the situation or a solution in one or two sentences.
I still remember when Peter in the beginning of 2020 said "I think this COVID thing might take a while".At the time, everyone thought COVID would blow over in a few weeks and the thought of it taking a year was unthinkable to many.
Peter has also been very succesful in summarizing problems that I was having with time management.
Once he summarized the situation, the solution was easy for me to find.

From Frank I have learned many things; especially that it's a good idea to have some optimism and tryout new tools.
Also Frank has been a very reliable source of support for the most difficult software questions.
He has a great ability to see the big picture in complex technical problems.
This has been very helpful in the development of the software that was used in this thesis.
More importantly, Frank always made time for a chat even when he later started to run his own company.

Where Peter and Frank have had to deal with my stubbornness some of the time, Ruud has had to deal with it all of the time.
My apologies to Ruud for that.
And probably to Steffie as well since I probably haven't always been the best for Ruud his mood.
I'm incredibly impressed by Ruud his patience and his unwaivering support.
Each time that I talked myself into seeing some situation as unfixable, Ruud was there to see the other side of the coin.
And he was always quickly available.
I think that in all these years, he has responded only one time not within 24 hours.
I'm also impressed by his ability to learn new things.
Ruud has picked up many of the statistical methods that were used in this thesis in a very short time.
I'm impressed that he understands these computer/data science methods fully including many of its nuances.
I'm also impressed by his ability to keep his cool in difficult situations.
All in all, I highly recommend Ruud as a supervisor.
It has been a great pleasure to work with him.

This thesis would not have been possible without the support of the Korps Commandotroepen.
I will keep this short out of respect for the privacy of the special forces, but let me say this:
The people that I have met made me feel confident that our country's defense is in good hands.
A special thanks goes to the members of the Human Performance Team.
Each time I visited the organization, they made sure that everything was arranged.
Next, they asked me about my research and gave useful and practical feedback.
This has been extremely helpful to keep me on track.
Without them, the research would probably have ended up in something that looked great in theory but didn't work in practice.
A special thanks goes out to Maurits who got this project started.
I have learned a lot from him especially about collaborating with people and how to remain empathetic even under pressure.

Next to work, I'm thankful for the support of my parents and the family of my girlfriend.
My father, Wout, has showed me "gewoon rustig doorgaan" (just calmly continue).
He knows that finishing things is not a matter of speed, but a matter of perseverance.
My mother, Nely, has always motivated me to do my best in school.
Without my mother I would probably never have obtained my MSc degree, so I would never have started this PhD.
Without my father, I would probably have dropped out halfway through the PhD.
But luckily, rustig doorgaan has worked.
I'm very thankful for the family of my girlfriend: Barbara, JÃ¶rg, Jens, and Silvia have been very welcoming and supportive.

Next to my family, friends have been very important in relativizing some of the issues that came up during the PhD.
I would like to thank Hylke, Koen, Henry, Yannick, Jose, Mark, Sjors,  for their support.

I'm very luckily that two friends accepted my request to be my paranimfen: Yannick and Hylke.
Both have been very supportive in the past years.
Yannick has often explained to me in words that I could understand why Ruud was right.
He has also set a great example of how to be productive while still having a good work-life balance.
Hylke has been very supportive in the past years.
He was the one who gave helpful feedback on my MSc thesis years ago and who again gave helpful feedback on various papers.
Especially the visualizations of the SIRUS model were greatly improved by his feedback.
I'm very grateful for their support and I'm looking forward to doing the defense with them.

Finally, thanks to Hanna for her unwaivering support.
I think that she will be more happy than me when this PhD is finally done.
Although it was my idea to do this, she has experienced most of the ups and downs from closeby.
She showed me that binary thinking is not always correct.
Maybe it works for software, but not for everything else.
Thanks to her the downs were less deep and the ups were higher.
