If it turns out I have seen more, it is because I stood on the shoulders of giants.
I would like to thank everybody who supported me in the past years to make this dissertation possible.

I would like to thank my supervisors Ruud, Frank and Peter for their continuous support and guidance.
"Challenge all assumptions" is an idea that I think is very important, but at the same time I am aware that I was not an easy PhD student to supervise.
There have been many assumptions that I have challenged, which turned out to be correct.
This must have been very frustrating since the supervisers had to spend time to explain why the these obvious assumptions were correct.
Furthermore, I have made their job more difficult by being very peristent (read: stubborn) in my ideas.
Still, from time to time I have taken their advice to heart and I am grateful for their guidance.
From Peter I have learned that it not such a bad idea to give sincere compliments from time to time.
I always thought "why give a compliment, they already know they are doing a good job", but Peter made me change my mind and I am very grateful for that.
From Frank I have learned many things; especially that it's a good idea to have some optimism and tryout new tools.
Also Frank has been a very reliable source of support for the most difficult software questions.

I used to never do this, but I have now incorporated this into my life.
As Peter

This thesis is based on the ideas from friends, family, colleagues, mentors, and teachers in major ways.
I would like to thank the following people by listing some ideas that they contributed.
When there are quotation marks, the text is a literal quote.
Otherwise, the text is my best effort to summarize an idea that people told me or taught me through their actions.

\
*Age de Wit*: Hmm yes that sounds nice in theory, but in practice it won't work because ... \
*Frank Blaauw*: Don't focus too much on reasons why the approach might not work, but instead have some optimism and focus on why the approach might work. \
*Hanna Tobaben*: Not everything is binary. \
*John Boyd*, *Elon Musk*, and *Steve Jobs*: Challenge all assumptions. \
*John von Neumann* and *Hylke Donker*: With enough free parameters, you can fit an elephant. \
*Maurits Baatenburg de Jong*: Be humble. \
*Nely Schutte*, *Ben Graham*, and *Warren Buffett*: "You're not right or wrong because a thousand people agree with you and you're not right or wrong because a thousand people disagree with you. You are right when your facts and reasoning are right." \
*Peter de Jonge*: Don't forget to give sincere compliments from time to time. \
*Ruud den Hartigh*: Don't postpone things that you can do today. \
*Wout Huijzer*: "Gewoon rustig doorgaan." (Just calmly continue.) \
*Yannick Hill* and *Jose Storopoli*: It's okay to sometimes complain about things, but at some point you just have to get the work done. \

To these people and the many other people who's ideas ended up in this thesis, thank you.
