I would like to thank everybody who supported me to make this dissertation possible.
If there are parts of the thesis that are good, it is because of you.

I would like to thank you, Ruud, Frank and Peter for your continuous support and guidance.
"Challenge all assumptions" is an idea that I think is very important, but at the same time I am aware that this made me a difficult student.
There have been many assumptions that I have challenged, where it turned out it was entirely me who was wrong.
To make things worse, I often did not listen to your counterarguments.
I'm very grateful that you have not given up on me or the project.
From time to time, I have taken your advice to heart and I am grateful for your guidance.

From you, Peter, I have learned that it not such a bad idea to give sincere compliments from time to time.
I always thought "why give a compliment, they already know they are doing a good job", but you made me change my mind and I am very grateful for that.
You have also solved many of the problems that came up during the PhD.
Like those times that you suggested a solution to difficult reviewer comments.
I'm also still impressed by your ability to take a complex situation and express the situation or a solution in one or two sentences.
Like when you summarzied my time management problems in one sentence, which allowed me to solve them.

Frank, from you I have learned many things; especially that it's a good idea to have some optimism and tryout new tools.
You have been a very reliable source of support for the most difficult software questions.
You have a great

ability to see the big picture in complex technical problems.
This has been very helpful in the development of the software, to always have a backup for questions.
More importantly, you always made time for a chat even when you later started to run your own company.

Where Peter and Frank have had to deal with my stubbornness some of the time, you, Ruud, have had to deal with it all of the time.
I'm incredibly impressed by your patience and unwaivering support.
Each time that I talked myself into seeing some situation as unfixable, you were there to see the other side of the coin.
And you were always available.
I'm also impressed by your ability to keep your cool in difficult situations.
All in all, I highly recommend you as a supervisor.
It has been a great pleasure to work with you.

This thesis would not have been possible without the support of the Korps Commandotroepen.
The people that I have met made me feel confident that our country's defense is in good hands.
Thank you, Maurits, for getting this project off the ground.
I have learned a lot from you.
Especially about how to collaborate with people and how to remain empathetic even under pressure.
A special thanks goes to the members of the Human Performance Team.
Each time I visited the organization, you, Koen, Age, Jaco, Wayne, and others made sure that everything was arranged.
Next, you asked me about the research and gave useful and practical feedback.
This has been extremely helpful to keep me on track.
Without you, the research would probably have ended up in something that looked great in theory but didn't work in practice.

I would also like to thank the reading committee of this thesis:
Rob Meijer, George Azzopardi, and Steven Verstockt.
Thank you for your time and effort to read this thesis.

I'm also thankful for the colleagues at the university.
Thank you Hanneke, Solomiia, Hugh, Joske, Juan, Gemma, Nicol, Bart, Niklas, Jur, Jan and others for the _gezellige_ dinners and lunch breaks.

Next to work, I'm thankful for the support of my parents and the family of my girlfriend.
Wout, you have showed me "gewoon rustig doorgaan" (just calmly continue).
You know that finishing things is not a matter of speed, but a matter of perseverance.
Without you, I might have dropped out halfway through the PhD.
But luckily, "rustig doorgaan" has worked.
Nely, you have always motivated me to do my best in school.
Without you I would probably never have obtained my MSc degree, so I would never have started this PhD.
I'm also very thankful for the family of my girlfriend.
Barbara, JÃ¶rg, Jens, and Silvia, you have been very welcoming and supportive throughout the years.

Next to my family, friends have been very important in relativizing some of the issues that came up during the PhD.
I would like to thank you Mark, Alex, Sjors, Koen, Rodger, Henry, and Hagen for your support.
I've spent many days or evenings with you being frustrated about something that took longer than I would have liked.
Luckily, you were always there for a chat and from time to time laughed a bit at the situation which helped me a lot.
Jose, thank you for your support throughout the years.
You have always been there for quick software or statistical questions.
I'm very grateful for the many times that you were there to listen and give advice.
I'm also very grateful for when you invited me to write a book together.
It led to a crazy half year, but I learned a lot from you.

I'm very luckily that two friends accepted my request to be my paranimfen: Yannick and Hylke.
Thank you both for your support throughout the years.
Yannick, you have often explained to me in words that I could understand why I was wrong.
You have also set a great example of how to be productive while still having a good work-life balance.
I still remember that time we called Sunday evening at 21:30 and you said you should hang up because you still had to go home.
I asked you where you were and you said "I'm at the university".
I have tons of respect for your ability to work hard but still take time off when necessary.
Hylke, you have been very supportive in the past years.
You were the one who gave helpful feedback on my MSc thesis years ago and who again gave helpful feedback on various papers.
Especially the visualizations of the SIRUS model were greatly improved by you.
Also, I've learned many statistical things from you.
You have always been there for algorithmic discussions and a beer.
I'm very grateful for both your support and I'm looking forward to doing the defense with you.

Finally, thank you Hanna for all your support.
I think that you will be more happy than me when this PhD is finally done.
Although it was my idea to do this, you have experienced most of the ups and downs from closeby.
You showed me that binary thinking is not always correct.
Maybe it works for software, but not always for the real world.
Thanks to you, the downs were less deep and the ups were higher.
