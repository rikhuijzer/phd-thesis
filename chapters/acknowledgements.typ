If it turns out I have seen more, it is because I stood on the shoulders of giants.
I would like to thank everybody who supported me in the past years to make this dissertation possible.

I would like to thank my supervisors Ruud, Frank and Peter for their continuous support and guidance.
"Challenge all assumptions" is an idea that I think is very important, but at the same time I am aware that this made me a difficult student.
There have been many assumptions that I have challenged, where it turned out I was wrong.
This must have been very frustrating since the supervisers had to spend time to explain why the these obvious assumptions were correct.
To make things worse, I often did not listen to the counterarguments.
This has lead to some explosive meetings where the supervisors luckily kept their cool and have been very capable in calming me down and finding a common ground.
From time to time, I have taken their advice to heart and I am grateful for their guidance.

From Peter I have learned that it not such a bad idea to give sincere compliments from time to time.
I always thought "why give a compliment, they already know they are doing a good job", but Peter made me change my mind and I am very grateful for that.
Peter has suggested many of the statistical methods that were used in this thesis.
Also, Peter has found clever ways in which to address some difficult reviewer comments.
I'm still most impressed by Peter's ability to take a complex situation and express the situation or a solution in one or two sentences.
I still remember when Peter in the beginning of 2020 said "I think this COVID thing might take a while".At the time, everyone thought COVID would blow over in a few weeks and the thought of it taking a year was unthinkable to many.
Peter has also been very succesful in summarizing problems that I was having with time management.
Once he summarized the situation, the solution was easy for me to find.

From Frank I have learned many things; especially that it's a good idea to have some optimism and tryout new tools.
Also Frank has been a very reliable source of support for the most difficult software questions.
He has a great ability to see the big picture in complex technical problems.
This has been very helpful in the development of the software that was used in this thesis.
More importantly, Frank always made time for a chat even when he later started to run his own company.

Where Peter and Frank have had to deal with my stubbornness some of the time, Ruud has had to deal with it all of the time.
I'm incredibly impressed by his patience and his unwaivering support.
Each time that I talked myself into seeing some situation as unfixable, Ruud was there to see the other side of the coin.
And he was always quickly available.
I think that in all these years, he has responded only one time not within 24 hours.
I'm also impressed by his ability to learn new things.
Ruud has picked up many of the statistical methods that were used in this thesis in a very short time.
I'm impressed that he understands these computer/data science methods fully including many of its nuances.
I'm also impressed by his ability to keep his cool in difficult situations.
All in all, I highly recommend Ruud as a supervisor.
It has been a great pleasure to work with him.


This thesis is based on the ideas from friends, family, colleagues, mentors, and teachers in major ways.
I would like to thank the following people by listing some ideas that they contributed.
When there are quotation marks, the text is a literal quote.
Otherwise, the text is my best effort to summarize an idea that people told me or taught me through their actions.

\
*Age de Wit*: Hmm yes that sounds nice in theory, but in practice it won't work because ... \
*Frank Blaauw*: Don't focus too much on reasons why the approach might not work, but instead have some optimism and focus on why the approach might work. \
*Hanna Tobaben*: Not everything is binary. \
*John Boyd*, *Elon Musk*, and *Steve Jobs*: Challenge all assumptions. \
*John von Neumann* and *Hylke Donker*: With enough free parameters, you can fit an elephant. \
*Maurits Baatenburg de Jong*: Be humble. \
*Nely Schutte*, *Ben Graham*, and *Warren Buffett*: "You're not right or wrong because a thousand people agree with you and you're not right or wrong because a thousand people disagree with you. You are right when your facts and reasoning are right." \
*Peter de Jonge*: Don't forget to give sincere compliments from time to time. \
*Ruud den Hartigh*: Don't postpone things that you can do today. \
*Wout Huijzer*: "Gewoon rustig doorgaan." (Just calmly continue.) \
*Yannick Hill* and *Jose Storopoli*: It's okay to sometimes complain about things, but at some point you just have to get the work done. \
\
To these people and the many other people who's ideas ended up in this thesis, thank you.
